## Issues

One of the main issues with the Material UI library that is generally used in ReactJS is that it doesn't work with Native. So we won't be able to implement Material UI. But ReactNative has a few components from their own Material UI equivalent. These will be listed below

## ReactNative Material UI

- React Native Paper
  - TextInput for a Floating Label
  - Checkbox's
  - Buttons

```
1. npm install react-native-paper

2. import { Button } from "react-native-paper";

3. use the component
```

- React Native Material UI

```
1. npm install "react-native-material-ui"

2. import { Toolbar } from "react-native-material-ui";

3. use the component
```

- There are a lot more out there too that we can import so not have Material UI from ReactJS is not a big issue.
