# `Reflection Document`

## The Assignment

Your reflection document should include the following elements:

- Start with an objective description of your experience. This includes answering the following questions:
  - What did you do (this should highlight individual contribution)?
  - Who was involved with you in the different phases of the project?
  - Why did you choose to do this project?
- Analyse how the experience of doing the project contributed to an understanding of your own self (you may talk about your strengths, weaknesses, skill assumptions etc, things that emerged as a result of undertaking the project), of others, of the process of software development (in general).
- Articulate your learning by answering the following questions:
  - What did I learn?
  - How did I learn it?
  - Why is it important?
  - How will I use it in future?
- Provide an evaluation of the performance of the team as a whole.
- Include a recommended grade for the other members in your team and why this grade should be awarded.
  - Please be honest in your evaluation. This information will be kept confidential

A lot of this information will be available in the weekly journals that you have been writing.
Remember that this document is your own personal account of the development experience. You need to write your own views using first person to relate personal experience. Try to balance personal opinion with objective interpretation (drawing on theory/anecdotal evidence)
